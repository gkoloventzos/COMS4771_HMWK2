\section{Problem 1}
\subsection{A}
As perceptron is in $\mathbb{R}^d$ means that can shatter a d+1
points. As a perceptron in 2d is like a linear classifier it means
that in d dimensions can shatter d+1 points. From that I conclude that 
the VC dimension of a perceptron is d+1.
\subsection{B}
Suppose VC(H)=d. Then H will require $2^d$ distinct hypotheses to shatter d instances.
So as H can shatter in 2 classes it means that $2^d \leq \lvert H\rvert$.
\begin{eqnarray}
2^{VC(H)} \leq \lvert H\rvert \Leftrightarrow
VC(H) \leq \log_2 \lvert H\rvert
\end{eqnarray}
